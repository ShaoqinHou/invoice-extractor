# Patterns

Reusable app-level patterns that sit between primitives (`components/ui/`) and domain components (`features/`).

Place components here when a pattern is used across 3+ features and is too complex for a simple primitive but too generic for a single feature.

Examples: confirmation dialogs, data tables with pagination, form field groups, empty state illustrations.
